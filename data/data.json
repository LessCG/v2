You play with your blocks until they break and these walls come tumbling down, oh they're tumbling down. Your out of time, make your move, live or die while the fuse is on fire. Kiss your perfect day goodbye because the world is on fire. Tuck your innocence, goodnight. You sold your friends like guns for hire. Go play with your blocks and now you'll pay when these walls come tumbling down, oh they're tumbling down. Resting on a knife, you heavy sould with all this weight buckling down on you now. Don't you drown and float away, not a goog time to lose control right as your marionettes cut their strings and run away. You're out out of time, make your move, live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no coming back."
